Hello world! I am Andriel, or Andri(!), for short. I'm a CompSci Major, and I think
I'm starting to really develop a passion for programming and software development, 
as well as gamedev. It's a super fascinating industry and I would absolutely love to 
be somewhat involved in it! I also have big interests in worldbuilding, linguistics
and languages, and I really like to incorporate that into a lot of stuff that I do.
